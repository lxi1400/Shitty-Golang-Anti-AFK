# Shitty Golang Anti-AFK
VERY ugly code, made on a rush with still very little golang knowledge

# Usage
**Download the zip and extract it**
**Make sure you have [golang](https://golang.org/dl/) installed, and run `go run .`
**Insert your token and the channel id you wish for it to send/read messages from**
**and boom! Enjoy the Anti-AFK**


# code is ugly i get it but it works so
